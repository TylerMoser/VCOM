Working notes for VCOM, a turn-based tactics prototype (XCOM / Star Wars: Zero Company) in Godot
4.7 on a voxel grid. `README.md` has the player-facing rules; this file is about working in the
code.

## Layout

The git root is `VoxelXCOM/`; the Godot project is `vcom/`, which is where commands are run from.
`MagicaVoxel/` holds source `.vox` art outside the project. `Styles/` holds candidate visual styles
(screenshots, exact settings, a render harness) not yet applied; `Styles/APPLYING.md` explains how
to apply one.

## Architecture

**Actions are nodes.** `ActionController` takes its `UnitAction` children as the actions offered on
the action bar; `ActionBar` builds one button per child. The first child is the default activated on
selection. Add an action by writing a `UnitAction` subclass and adding it as a child in the scene —
no UI code changes needed.

An action gets `begin(unit)` / `end()` / `handle_input(event)` / `is_available(unit)`, sets
`controller.busy = true` while it plays out, and emits `completed` when done. The controller then
re-`begin`s it if it is still available, or drops it.

**Highlights are named layers.** `TileHighlights.set_layer(name, {tile: Color}, fill)` — each caller
owns a layer, last set draws on top. Current layers: `selected`, `move`, `move_path`,
`shoot_step_out`, `overwatch`.

**The HUD is written in code, not scenes.** Widgets build their children in `_init()` and style
themselves with `StyleBoxFlat` overrides. Follow that rather than adding `.tscn` files for UI.

**Node wiring is `@export var *_path: NodePath` + `get_node_or_null` + `push_error`.** Keep that
pattern. Something optional (like `ShotOverlay` in `ShootAction` and `TurnManager`) errors but
carries on behind `if x != null`; something essential bails.

**Enemy AI is a `Resource` that only decides.** Each enemy has `Unit.ai` (like `Unit.weapon`), set in
the scene to a shared `.tres` such as `Resources/AI/Assault.tres`. `TurnManager._take_enemy_turn`
asks `ai.choose_action(Tactics.new(...))` once per action and carries out the `AIAction`, charging
squad costs: `ceil(tiles / move_range)` for a move (at least 1, and cut to what the unit can afford),
`ShootAction.COST` for a shot. So a new enemy type is an `EnemyAI` subclass plus a `.tres`; no turn,
reaction or camera code changes. Put reusable queries on `Tactics`, not in one AI. AI resources are
shared between units, so they must stay stateless (the same rule as `Weapon`). An enemy with no `ai`
sits its turn out with a warning.

**Enemies walk through `Reactions.walk()`.** It starts the walk with `Unit.start_walk()` so it holds
the tween, then polls it each frame: on every new tile it works out who on overwatch could fire
(`_find_offers`), opens or closes the window, slows the tween (`slow_motion_scale`), and holds it at
speed 0 while a reaction shot plays out. `TurnManager` calls `release_view()` after each enemy's
turn to hand the camera back. A window only exists during a walk; nothing else opens one.

**A shot is settled when it is fired and lands when it arrives.** `Unit.shoot_at(shot, chance,
grid, show_rounds)` rolls, then asks `Ballistics` for the round's `Path`: the sight line for a hit;
for a miss, XCOM 2's placement, an aim point on a ring around the target's body (or, `COVER_SHARE`
of the time, on the target's cover) traced with `CombatGrid.cast()` until something stops it or it
leaves the map. It then awaits `show_rounds` (`ShotOverlay.show_rounds`, which draws the tracer and
returns as it lands), and only then damages the target and reports any terrain the round struck
through `CombatGrid.strike()` as `terrain_struck`. `shoot_at` is a coroutine; always `await` it.

**Breakable blocks are data.** `TerrainDestruction` (a node in each map) listens to
`terrain_struck` and looks the struck block up in `Resources/Destruction/Catalog.tres`, a
`DestructionCatalog` of `Destruction` resources each naming a block by its MeshLibrary item name.
A block with no entry never breaks. A breaking block leaves the grid at once, then its destruction's
`shatter(site, at, hit)` plays out what is left under the `TerrainDestruction` node, `at` being
where the grid drew the block's mesh. Any breakable block left with nothing under it breaks too, so
stacks come down, and a unit left standing on nothing drops (`Unit.drop_to`) through that rubble.

To make another object break like the crate:

1. Model the pieces in MagicaVoxel in the same frame as the block's own model, as separate models.
2. Import the `.vox` as a Scene at **Scale 0.0625**, the blocks' scale, or the pieces will not line
   up with the block they replace. Make an inherited scene of it in `Scenes/` to add to.
3. Make a `ScriptedDestruction` `.tres` in `Resources/Destruction/` naming the block and that scene,
   and add it to `Catalog.tres`.

Every bare mesh in the scene becomes a rigid body with a box collider; a `RigidBody3D` you author is
used as it is, and other nodes are left alone. A new way of breaking is a `Destruction` subclass
that overrides `shatter()`, the same shape as a new enemy being an `EnemyAI` subclass.

**Physics is only for debris.** Layers: 1 terrain, 2 unit clicks (`Unit.PICK_LAYER`), 3 debris,
4 unit bodies (`Unit.BODY_LAYER`). Blocks have no collision in the MeshLibrary, so
`TerrainDestruction` gives the map a copy of it with a cube on every shapeless block. Debris stays
live for good and sleeps when still. Each unit carries an `AnimatableBody3D` capsule, starting
`Unit.BODY_CLEARANCE` above its feet, that shoves debris aside and is never pushed back. Debris
knocked off the map, or wedged inside a block, is removed. The rules never look at debris.

## Conventions

- `##` doc comments on every class and non-obvious method, written in plain prose explaining *why*,
  not restating the signature.
- `&"name"` StringNames for groups and input actions; `^"path"` NodePaths.
- Nullable returns use `Variant` with a `null` check (`find_shot`, `current_shot`, `pick_tile`), so
  callers need an explicit type annotation to unpack them.
- Units are in group `units` plus `players` or `enemies`.

## Combat rules that must not drift

- A unit fills **two cells** (`CombatGrid.UNIT_HEIGHT`) and sights from the centre of the upper one
  (`LineOfSight.EYE_HEIGHT`). This is what makes 1-cell blocks half cover (never blocks sight) and
  2-cell blocks full cover (blocks it).
- **Step-out requires cover.** A unit in the open fires from its own tile only.
- **Flanked ≠ uncovered.** `Shot.flanked` is true only when the target has cover that does not face
  the shot. A target in the open is "In the Open" and gets no flanking bonus.
- Everything about a shot — cover, height, distance — is measured from `Shot.from`, the tile the
  shot is *taken* from, which may be a step-out tile.
- **Hit chance is computed once**, when the shot is lined up (`ShootAction._estimate`), and that is
  what gets rolled. Do not recompute at fire time. A reaction's shot is lined up each time the enemy
  reaches a new tile (`Reactions._find_offers`); its prompt shows that estimate and firing rolls it.
- `Unit.shoot_at(shot, chance, grid, show_rounds)` is the single place a shot is resolved.
  `ShootAction`, the enemy AI and reaction fire all go through it; keep it that way so they cannot
  diverge.
- **Where a round goes is decided once, after the roll, when it is fired** (XCOM 2's order), by
  `Ballistics`, and nothing recomputes it: the tracer draws that path and the terrain it ends on is
  what `terrain_struck` reports. One path per shot, as in XCOM 2.
- **A hit flies the sight line**, eye to eye, so it never touches terrain. Only misses strike it.
- **Stray rounds never wound anyone and never pass through a unit**, the target included, except a
  unit standing in the line of fire itself, which every round passes through since units never block
  sight. A miss never stops on terrain more than `Ballistics.SHORT_OF_TARGET` short of the target.
- **Damage and terrain strikes land when the round does**, inside `shoot_at`, not when it is fired.
- **A broken block leaves the grid the moment the round strikes it**, before any debris moves, so
  sight, cover and paths never wait on physics. Debris is for show: nothing in the rules reads it.
- **Reactions are Pathfinder's:** one per unit, refilled in `Unit.start_turn()`. Overwatch spends all
  remaining actions to hold it, and its shot takes `HitChance.REACTION_PENALTY` via
  `for_shot(..., reaction = true)`.
- **Enemy shots roll the odds their AI chose them by.** `Tactics` builds each `AIAction.shoot` with
  its `HitChance` estimate, and the turn manager rolls that one; it never recomputes.
- **Reactions are the player's call, never automatic.** Only an enemy *walking* in sight opens a
  window (not leaning out to shoot). Keys `1`-`4` follow `PlayerSquad.members`, which is the squad
  panel's order; `0` passes on the current move only, and the next move is a new trigger.
- Units never block line of sight. Only terrain does.

## Verification

This project is verified by **running Godot headless and looking at rendered frames**, not by
reasoning about the code. Godot is at
`C:\Program Files\Godot\Godot_v4.7-stable_win64_console.exe` (use the `_console` build so stdout is
captured). Run from `vcom/`.

```bash
G="/c/Program Files/Godot/Godot_v4.7-stable_win64_console.exe"

# Does the main scene load without errors?
"$G" --headless --path . --quit-after 120

# Render real frames, then Read a PNG. --headless CANNOT render; omit it.
"$G" --path . --quit-after 150 --write-movie out/f.png --resolution 1280x720

# Drive logic or inspect state: a SceneTree subclass with _initialize() + await process_frame.
"$G" --headless --path . --script /abs/path/probe.gd

# Run a specific scene
"$G" --path . res://Scenes/LineOfSightTest.tscn
```

Probe scripts belong in the scratchpad directory, not the repo. To render a scene in a particular
state, write a temporary `res://_probe/Probe.tscn` + `.gd` that instantiates the map and drives it,
render, then **delete `_probe/`**.

`Scenes/LineOfSightTest.tscn` is the harness for the sight and shot rules. Four sight lanes: open,
half cover, step-out around a pillar, and a wall that can only be leaned around from the north.
Three shot lanes: a target in the open with a crate backstop behind it, a low crate wall running
under the line of fire into the target's half cover, and a squad member standing right behind the
target. Its crates break, so a probe that shoots there changes the lanes as it goes. Prefer adding
a lane there over reasoning about geometry in your head.

Physics runs headless, and with `--fixed-fps 60` every physics step is exactly 1/60 s, so debris
can be tested without rendering: break a block by calling `CombatGrid.strike()` with a hand-built
`RayHit`, then wait on `physics_frame`.

A `--script` probe's scene is not ready during `_initialize()`: its nodes' `_ready` runs once the
main loop starts, so await a frame after `root.add_child()` before reading anything `_ready` sets up.

## Gotchas

**New `class_name` scripts do not resolve until you import.** Creating a `.gd` outside the editor
leaves it out of the global class cache, and every script referencing it fails with
`Could not find type "X"`. Run `--headless --path . --import` once after adding one.

**`_unhandled_input` runs in reverse tree order.** `ActionController` sits after `PlayerSquad` in
`CombatMap.tscn`, which is the only reason the active action can swallow `Tab` before the squad
cycles. Do not reorder those nodes.

**A unit's tween dies with it, without finishing.** `create_tween()` binds to the node, so a unit
freed mid-walk leaves `await tween.finished` hanging forever. Anything that can kill a walker on the
way (a reaction) must poll `tween.is_running()` instead, as `Reactions.walk()` does. A tween is still
`is_valid()` on the frame it finishes, so `is_running()` is the test for "still going".

**`is_action_pressed` ignores extra modifiers but honours required ones.** `Shift+Tab` matches both
`next_target` and `previous_target`, so `previous_target` must be tested **first** (see
`ShootAction.handle_input` and `PlayerSquad._unhandled_input`). `Ctrl+Tab` still matches
`next_target`, which is why `show_shot_details` can safely be Ctrl.

**A held key does not re-trigger `is_action_pressed`.** Real behaviour, and desirable — you cannot
hold `Enter` to machine-gun. When scripting input in a probe, send press *and* release or the second
press does nothing.

**`Vector2i` has no `dot()`.** Multiply the components out.

**`.tscn` `load_steps` must be bumped** when you add `ext_resource`/`sub_resource` entries by hand
(it is total resources + 1).

**Do not hand-write `Transform3D`, GridMap `data`, or `project.godot` input events.** The text
serialization order is not the constructor order. Have Godot print `var_to_str(...)`, or build the
scene with a script and `PackedScene.pack()` + `ResourceSaver.save()`. When packing, every node must
have `owner` set to the root, recursively, or it is silently dropped; clear `scene_file_path` for a
standalone copy. But set it only on the nodes you add: re-saving an instantiated scene with every
descendant owned also saves the children HUD widgets build in `_init()` (the target panel, the
banner's label), which then get built twice, and reshuffles resource ids. To add to an existing
scene, generate it that way and splice just the new blocks into the original text.

**`CombatGrid.cast()` never cuts a corner; `is_line_clear()` does.** A sight line slips between two
blocks that meet at a corner, a ray does not. Use `is_line_clear` for who can see whom and `cast` for
where something lands; a hit follows the sight line and is never cast.

**Headless quirks:** the dummy renderer logs a spurious `Parameter "material" is null` for
`StandardMaterial3D` overrides, and the viewport mouse position is pinned at `(0,0)` while the
window reports focus.

**`AnimatableBody3D.sync_to_physics` leaves a body behind when its parent moves.** It hands the
body's transform to the physics server, and a parent moving underneath does not tell it. A unit's
body moves with the unit's tweens, so it is not synced. Jolt still moves a kinematic body with
velocity when its transform is set, so it pushes debris properly.

**A GridMap cell's collision goes at the end of the frame, not on `set_cell_item()`.** Debris
spawned where a block just was would start inside the block's old collision and be flung out, so
`ScriptedDestruction` holds the pieces frozen until the next `physics_frame`.

**A kinematic body driven into a heap grinds thin pieces into whatever is under them.** That is why
a unit dropping into its own rubble passes through it (`drop_to`'s `rubble`), and why its body
starts above its feet.

**Map coordinates:** floor blocks sit at `y=0` and walkable tiles at `y=1` in both current maps.
`CombatGrid.tile_position(tile)` is the floor surface (where units stand);
`CombatGrid.cell_center(cell)` is the middle of a cell (used for eye positions).

**`LineOfSightTest.tscn` is generated**, by a throwaway script that instantiates `CombatMap.tscn`,
rebuilds the GridMap and repositions units. That script is not in the repo, so edit the scene
directly or write a fresh generator.

## Known gaps

- A shared `Weapon` resource must stay stateless; give it `resource_local_to_scene` before adding
  per-unit state like rounds remaining.
- Only crates break, and only one way. `Weapon.environment_damage` reaches `terrain_struck` but
  nothing reads it yet: any strike breaks a crate.
- Rounds fly straight through debris: the trace only sees the grid.
- The squad panel does not wrap: past about five members it runs under the action bar, which it does
  in the harness (eight).
